1- this is a file created for my first github cloning project with a brand-new user account via windows 
terminal. 

2- now it works, the problem was, I have to create the the directory and files on my local after I create my new
github account and repository. in addition, when I push the changes on the files on my local machine, I have
to use the command 'git push' instead of 'git push origin main/master', at least for the first push.
now everything works.
